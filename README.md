# jsfcm - JavaScript Fuzzy Cognitive Maps

This project is part of my PhD dissertation in Technical Management.

Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) are really cool. This project aims to make them cloud native by storing them in a graph database (CosmosDB) and retrieving and calculating them using Azure Functions. This code assumes that you're writing your Gremlin queries a particular way, but if you were getting data back in a different format you would just have to write different transformers to make it work.

This project is server code, the front end is a [conversational interface](https://github.com/cwhd/FCM-Sales-Helper-Bot).

## More to come

This project is just getting started, check back for updates!
